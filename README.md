# Bootstrap-3-website
This is a repository for my website build on Bootstrap 3 and also includes a login page. 
The goal of this project was to create a full-scale HTML project that showcases an understanding in Bootstrap 3.
All drop-down menus are functional. 
All images are positioned properly and the web page is fully scalable across various platforms.
